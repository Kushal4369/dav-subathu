                    Dear Parents, <br/>
                    The Motto of the school is Dedication, Determination and Discipline and I believe it should be followed by everyone. <br/>
                    This thinking should be inculcated in everyone, not just spoken out loud. Students must learn to share and care and become sensitive towards the world around them. Sensitive is the ability to look at people’s problems as your own, having a heart that beats for the welfare of all, the magnanimity of character to standby a friend in trouble times, the nobility of a soul that makes sure that it radiates happiness and generates a smile on all faces, a heartfelt compassion for all bonds of humanity and the grace and humanity to bow before the Almighty. <br/>
                    Social norms are the rules that a society uses for appropriate and in appropriate values, beliefs, attitude and behaviors. When an individual deviates from these conventional and social rules of society, stress sets in. We can learn to control our response to situations and develop techniques that will reduce the effect of stress on our mental and physical health. <br/>
                    Dear children, you are lucky that you are studying in one of the finest schools in the area of Subathu. Your education system of era’s variety of ways in which you can recognize and harness your talents. The managements of the school always ready to support your productive endeavors. Take full advantage of all the values that are open to you and you will soon find that there is no place for any kind of negative stress in your life. Develop with in yourselves a burning desire to achieve and keep alive the child like curiosity for learning something in every day, and I promise that there will never be a dull moment in your life. We look forward to work in partnership with all the stakeholders, and helping each of our students to have successful years ahead. <br/>
                    <p className='text-center font-medium text-xl p-2'>All The Best!!! </p>
